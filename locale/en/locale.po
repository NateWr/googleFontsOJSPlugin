msgstr "The Google Fonts plugin for OJS, OMP and OPS helps you use any <a href=\"{$googleFontsUrl}\" target=\"_blank\">Google Font</a> in your theme without compromising visitor privacy.

msgid "plugins.generic.googleFonts.help.fontsNotShown.answer"

If your theme doesn't do this for you automatically, you will need to add custom CSS code to your site. You can add custom CSS to your site by uploading a <code>.css</code> file to <strong>Settings > Appearance > Advanced > Style sheet</strong>."
